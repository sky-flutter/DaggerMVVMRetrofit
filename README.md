# DaggerMVVMRetrofit


I tried to implement Dagger dependency injection, retrofit with rxjava and apply MVVM architecture pattern to make code more reliable and anyone can easily understand.

There are many tutorial and blog where you can find but many of them used navigator pattern to share code from viewmodel to model.I apply livedata with viewmodel so when data fetch from the api, observer observe livedata and then use that data.I also try to inject fragment and viewmodel without viewmodel factory.
